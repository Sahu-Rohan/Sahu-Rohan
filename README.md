Hi,

My name is Rohan Sahu and I am a final year engineering undergraduate studying Computer Science—with a specialisation in Intelligent Systems—at Columbia University.
This is complemented by a dual degree in Economics from Georgetown. This is my github repository where I store work from my previous courses and other projects.

Due to school policy, my repositories are set by default to private. If you have recieved a link to my profile in connection with a job application, please let me know
at rohan.sahu@columbia.edu, and I will make sure to update your access. Feel free to contact me with any questions!

Sahu-Rohan/Sahu-Rohan is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
